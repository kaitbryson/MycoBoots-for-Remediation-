# MycoBoots-for-Remediation-
Mycoboots are boots that are made of mycelium and are grown to be worn in a performance of remedial proportions.  By merely coming into contact with heavy metals, certain species of fungi can bind those heavy metals to their tissue (mycelium), through a process called biosorption.  With this in mind, I am experimenting with growing the Mycoboots in order to attempt to remediate the polluted San Juan River in Northwestern New Mexico.  This river was polluted with heavy metals in 2015 when the holding tanks of an abandoned mine burst.  These tanks were filled with 130-year old mine waste (heavy metals) and emptied directly into the Animas River, which is a tributary of the San Juan River.    In this repository, you will find photos of my process of forming the boots, and you will also find a step-by-step guide for how I went about this experiment.
